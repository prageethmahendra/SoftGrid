 * The Client Service Access Point is used to connect to IEC 60870-5-104 servers. A client application that wants to
 * connect to a server should first create an instance of ClientSap. Next all the necessary configuration parameters can
 * be set. Finally the {@link ClientSap#connect(InetAddress) connect} function is called to connect to the server. An
 * instance of ClientSap can be used to create an unlimited number of connections. Changing the parameters of a
 * ClientSap has no affect on connections that have already been created.
 *
 * Note that the configured lengths of the fields COT, CA and IOA have to be the same for all communicating nodes in a
 * network. The default values used by ClientSap are those most commonly used in IEC 60870-5-104 communication.
